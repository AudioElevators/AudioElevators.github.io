My alarm goes off. It's 5am. 

*Time to get up.* 

I tell my Google Hub to turn off my alarm and I groggily slump out of my bed. The world is still dark and I turn on the bathroom light, blinding eyes that only got 5 hours of sleep. 

After a cup of coffee, I grab my guitar and throw it in the trunk of my car before I head off down the driveway of my apartment and towards Christ the King, where I primarly manage operations. Also, I run their websites. Oh, and design their graphics. Plus, I lead worship on occasion, which is why my guitar is in the trunk on this particular Sunday. 

*God, I'm so tired of this. *

Before anyone else shows up, the sun peeks past the horizon as I unload everything you would need for a pop up church. Sound equipment, projector screens, hospitality carts, and a million other things I've seen every Sunday for the past year. 

Once my volunteers come, we set the stage in the elementary school's auditorium. Everyone else from the church staff arrive by 9 and worship begins. I sing on stage, I sit down, I do sound, I sing again, I pack everything up, I go home. 

*Another day, another dollar.*

But does it have to be this way?

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for having this position in the first place because it pays the bills. But, see, that's just it. I want to be doing something that it allowing me to pay my bills is just an added *bonus*. That, with my own skills, I can contribute ideas and make decisions and create powerful things and love doing it all at the same time. When I expressed my feelings of being at a dead end job with my girlfriend, she reccomended I look into bootcamps since she knew I loved working with computers and keeping up with the latest tech. And that's how I found FlatIron. 

The structure of the programs, the online flexibility, the networking with people already in the field -- it was everything I needed in a school. But, I still didn't know what I wanted to do. Computers, sure, but there was a ton of different programs I could choose from. This would be a tough decision. I scoured the internet, looking at videos and websites for an answer. 

Finally, search after search, I stumbled upon a website with a venn diagram that outlined all the important aspects of data science: programming skills, math and statistics, analytics, and machine learning were a few. Each one intrigued and entertained me to the possibilities of things I could do as a data scientist, from analyzing predictive models with the patterns I often see in daily life to making code that could help a business run more efficiently. It seemed like all of the skills I had learned in my life time were combined in one profession -- like a collision of creative and scientific worlds! 

I'm so excited to see where this journey into data science takes me.
