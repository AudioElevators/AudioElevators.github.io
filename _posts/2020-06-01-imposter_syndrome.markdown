I have always struggled with feeling like I don't quite belong in many facets of my life. Engineering, music creation, art — I’m good at. But, not good enough. I always compare whatever I'm doing to the top person in the field, and the inadequacy begins to pour over me.  I have talked myself out of more opportunities than I can count, and the only reason I remember is **"I could never do this right"**. 

When I had stumbled upon data science, it looked so intriguing to me. I'm a great prediction analyst and my brain always tries to figure out how to do things more efficiently.  So, I dove in to the bootcamp and tried to stay busy to not let my anxiety and doubts take control this time.

For this Module Project, my job was to analyze the movie trends of the last 10 years and give my business recommendations for a company trying to break into the market.  “Seems easy enough”, I thought. I've cleaned and visualized data before. This should be no different than what I've been practicing for months. 

I guess my brain had other plans. 

Everything I did involving the project was coupled with mental blocks and doubt. It took me almost a week to write out my exploratory analysis questions, and up to the very last day to turn in my GitHub and blog.

I can't believe I had let it happen to me again. About a week ago, when I was mostly filled with shame, I went on to Slack to check what the plan was for the day and I had a comment from one of my classmates in the Cohort. They had thanked me publicly for my input and assurance that had helped them keep chugging along with the project to get it done.

I know it sounds corny, but I had teared up over this message.  Something as small as that was enough to get me moving on with my project, finish it, and have something that I can be proud of. That is what I love most about the Data Science cohort and coding: the community, all pushing each other forward. Taking the time to make sure no one is left behind, because someday that "thank you" message might be the thing that makes pushes you to do something great.
